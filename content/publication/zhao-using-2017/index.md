abstract: In eukaryotic cells, the smallest subunit of chromatin is the nucleosome,
  which consists of a segment of DNA wound on histone protein cores. Despite many
  years of effort, the process of nucleosome assembly and disassembly is still not
  very clear. Here, we present a convenient method to investigate the process of nucleosome
  assembly at the single molecule level. We invented a novel system derived from the
  yeast nucleoplasmic extracts (YNPE), and demonstrated that the YNPE supports the
  nucleosome assembly under physiological condition. By combining the total internal
  reﬂection ﬂuorescence microscopy with microﬂuidic ﬂow-cell technique, the dynamic
  process of nucleosome assembly in YNPE was visualized at single-molecule level.
  Our system provides a novel in vitro single-molecule tool to investigate the dynamics
  of nucleosome assembly under physiological conditions.
