abstract: Archaeal chromatin proteins Cren7 and Sul7d from Sulfolobus are DNA benders.
  To better understand their architectural roles in chromosomal DNA organization,
  we analyzed DNA compaction by Cren7 and Sis7d, a Sul7d family member, from Sulfolobus
  islandicus at the single-molecule (SM) level by total single-molecule internal reﬂection
  ﬂuorescence microscopy (SM-TIRFM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). We show that
  both Cren7 and Sis7d were able to compact singly tethered ␭ DNA into a highly condensed
  structure in a three-step process and that Cren7 was over an order of magnitude
  more efﬁcient than Sis7d in DNA compaction. The two proteins were similar in DNA
  bending kinetics but different in DNA condensation patterns. At saturating concentrations,
  Sis7d formed randomly distributed clusters whereas Cren7 generated a single and
  highly condensed core on plasmid DNA. This observation is consistent with the greater
  ability of Cren7 than of Sis7d to bridge DNA. Our results offer signiﬁcant insights
  into the mechanism and kinetics of chromosomal DNA organization in Crenarchaea.
