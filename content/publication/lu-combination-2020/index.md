abstract: Raman spectroscopy is a nondestructive, label-free, highly speciﬁc approach
  that provides the chemical information on materials. Thus, it is suitable to be
  used as an eﬀective analytical tool to characterize biological samples. Here we
  introduce a novel method that uses artiﬁcial intelligence to analyze biological
  Raman spectra and identify the microbes at a single-cell level. The combination
  of a framework of convolutional neural network (ConvNet) and Raman spectroscopy
  allows the extraction of the Raman spectral features of a single microbial cell
  and then categorizes cells according to their spectral features. As the proof of
  concept, we measured Raman spectra of 14 microbial species at a single-cell level
  and constructed an optimal ConvNet model using the Raman data. The average accuracy
  of classiﬁcation by ConvNet is 95.64 ± 5.46%. Meanwhile, we introduced an occlusion-based
  Raman spectra feature extraction to visualize the weights of Raman features for
  distinguishing diﬀerent species.
